### TODO List:

- Use octree data structure to detect collision
- Allow users to change the amount and weight of the spheres
- Add a tracer line for the big sphere (eyeCandy)

# Brownian Motion 3D

This code is a simulation of the Brownian Motion in 3D using three.js for my physics undergraduate class. The coefficient of restitution is assumed to be at 1.0. The particles have no definition and it's speed are all random.

# How to run

```sh
$ cd 'name of directory where you want the files'
$ git clone https://github.com/QuaziH/Brownian-Motion-3D.git #or clone your own fork
$ cd Brownian-Motion-3D
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
